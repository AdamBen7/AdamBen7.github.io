##Projects:
Detail pages on portfolio designs
Propulsion project code?
Bash scripts and my .vimrc/bashrc setups?

##Ambitious Future:
Figure out displaying 3d models using three.js or WebGL or something similar
Use javascript to generate portfolio pages

##Thoughts:
To Blog or not to Blog...
Contact Me Form necessary?
About Me page necessary? (Currently part of home page)
Probably NOT going to add a custom comment section
