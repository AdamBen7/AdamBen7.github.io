2025 Update:
Website deactivated as it is no longer applicable to my life. Perhaps I might start another project in the future... We'll see!

[2018] Original:

Welcome to my Website!
As of December 30th, 2018 this site is in its development(content-wise) and testing(hosting) phases. 
I first started to learn web development on December 18th, 2018, and this website is my first public website.
Please let me know if you notice any bad practices. 

Thanks!
Adam
